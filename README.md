# News.Map
A map with points on countries that show news about each country.




If you want to run the code yourself, you'll need to:
1. Copy what is above into a javascript file called keys.js
2. Make an account in World News API and put your api key in the array.
3. You may need to download leaflet but it is included in the folder so you probably will not need it.
